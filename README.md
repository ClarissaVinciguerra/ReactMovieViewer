## Thoughts

As my first application in web development coming from a mobile background, this project has helped me gain a greater understanding and command of the fundamentals of React, HTML and CSS. I am excited to progress my learning in greater depth as I continue to explore the capabilities and complexities of the language all the while improving the simplicity and readability of my code.
